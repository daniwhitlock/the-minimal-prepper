## Description
Helping people is the foundation of The Minimal Preppers. With the calamities that have been going on within the United States and around the world, being prepared is crucial. Having enough for your basic needs is what we specialize in.  Whether it be knowing how much food you need to feed your family, how to make a 72 hour kit, or how much toilet paper your family needs, we got you covered. The best part, you can create your own username so that you can save your progress towards your goals.
